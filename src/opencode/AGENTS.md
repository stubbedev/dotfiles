# Agent Usage Guidelines

- **Always use `webfetch` whenever you are uncertain about any information, fact, or process.**
- **NEVER produce additional markdown files documenting changes unless you are specifically asked to do so.**
- If you are asked to document something as a file, but no file path or name is given, make the change in `README.md`.
- **Always check the current date before answering, to ensure the information being returned is not outdated.**
