# PulseAudio client configuration for PipeWire compatibility layer
#
# NOTE: PipeWire's PulseAudio compatibility layer does NOT support most PulseAudio
# client.conf options. This file is kept minimal to avoid warnings.
#
# All audio configuration (buffer sizes, sample rates, latency) should be done in:
# - pipewire.conf.d/99-usb-dock.conf (PipeWire core settings)
# - pipewire-pulse.conf.d/99-usb-dock.conf (PulseAudio compatibility layer)
#
# This file can be symlinked to:
# - ~/.config/pulse/client.conf (system-wide)
# - ~/.var/app/APP_ID/config/pulse/client.conf (per-flatpak app)
#
# PipeWire ignores most options here and uses its own configuration instead.
